# BEATSTARS Example Design (IST 322)

This website mock-up stems from a semester-long project in my Digital Strategy and Marketing course. We were tasked with drafting an SEO-focused one-page website based off of some initial wireframes we had drawn up in class.

To clarify, the idea of Beatstars is not something I have come up with, it is an existing business I decided to piggy-back on for the purposes of completing the assignment. 

I wouldn't consider this a great display of my technical ability, but rather my attention to detail regarding front-end design. 

# index.html

This portion of the assignment was simply to create a one-page website design that was attractive and showed adherence to some sort of keyword plan. You'll notice I center myself around "buy beats online", "sell beats", and "beats for sale". This isn't meant to be an art project or branding exercise, but rather getting the hang of optimizing website content for SERP and specific keywords. 

# landing-age-a.html/landing-page-b.html

These two iterations of index.html were part of a task to first develop a landing page (I chose to make an informerical-ish one) and then practice forming/implementing a hypothesis for A/B testing. My course of action here was the pretty simple choice of using a video instead of a photo, however I believe and have been taught to believe that smaller changes are more effective for this form of experimentation. The change in media format is enough to warrant a tangible change in user behavior or more specifically session length, so I felt comfortable keeping it simple here.

Apart from the experimentation, I though a great tactic for this particular business would be to show off the amount of features made available to the target audience (sellers/music producers) and display social proof. My thinking was that amateur musicians (the target audience for this landing page) are desperately and typically unsuccessfully making it on their own as digitial nomads, so the idea of fully "investing" time and resources into this service can be a hard sell. Overloading them with information to say otherwise feels like the best course of action here. This also supports my choice of divergence for the A/B experiment, as rather than having to read through this wall of information, the video might to a better job at convincing users who aren't interested in reading all of that.
